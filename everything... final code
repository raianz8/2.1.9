Scene 1.
The first function is to draw the adpple.
The web image is the background.
we are placing the copter at the coordinates 0,0.
We are setting the size to the width and 612.
we then add the copter
we then call the function of draw apple.
After the apple is added, he says he is scared of dying and wants to escape.

Scene 2.
the new copter is the the new background.
we set the position to -200, -500 and the size to 1280, and 1262.
we then add the copter.
The apple and onion then meet and frther confir their plan to escape.
we then called the function of draw apple and draw onion.
The 2 faces are set to 90, 85 and 225 and 105.

Scene 3. 
We draw a new web image of a new background.
This new copter is set to -500, -450.
The copter size is 1280, 1262.
we then add the copter.
As the apple and onion are escaping, the man comes back with a knife.
As the onion was in much pain, he told apple to escape and go on without him.
The apple agreed and with much greif, left without his friend onion.
We then call the function of draw knife, draw onion, and draw face.
the face is set at 100, 120.

Scene 4.
The man is unaware of the fact that the onion and apple were alive and wanted to escape.
As the man started to cry because he was cuttin the onion.
Seeing this, the apple then escaped.
The draw man function was then called.
the tearfunction was then called.

Scene 5.
the new web imgae is the new background.
The copter position is -200, -500
the size is 1280, 1262.
We then add the copter.
As the apple is escaping, he takes a moment to remember the onion who saved his life, after that, the apple was never seen again.
We then call the function of draw apple.
We then make the face.
The face position is 60, 95.

1. The function "draw finish"
print "And that's how the story ends, some earn their freedom and others do not..."

2. The function "draw apple"
We got the webimage of an apple.
We set the size to 225, 225.
We then added the copter.

3. the function "draw onion"
We got the web image of an onion.
We set the size to 300, 300
We then added the copter.

4. The function "draw onion 2"
We got the web image of another onion
we set the size to 275, 275.
We the added the copter.

5. The function "draw knife"
We got a web image of a knife.
we set the position to 0, -100
we set the size to (800 * 2/5, 533 * 2/5)
We then added the copter

6. The function "draw man"
We got the web image of a man.
We set the position to -450, 0.
we set the size to 1224, 816.

7. The function "tear"
We got the web image of a tear.
we set the position to 65, 250
we set the size to 920/10, 1214/10.
We then added the copter.

8. The function "draw face"
This is a polygon so we need to make our own points.
The points are for each eye.

9. The start function 
We have to get the web image of a fridge as the stting.
the position is -200, 0
We have our welcom and credit lines.
the position of welcome is  getWidth() / 2 - welcome.getWidth() / 2,getHeight() / 2
The position of credit is  getWidth() / 2 - credits.getWidth() / 2,
        getHeight() * 3/4
        
10. The "draw next scene function"
After one scene is concluded by a click, it goes to the next scene.
