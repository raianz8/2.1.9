1) Understand
    1. I understand Top-Down Design.

2) Break Down
    1. Story starts with Apple and Onion in a fridge.
    They escape when a man opens the fridge. He catches
    them but Onion sacrifices himself and dies causing 
    the man to cry and Apple escapes. We will have to
    make sprites and import the backgrounds as well.
    2. Import photo backgrounds for scenes 1-10. Draw
    Apple and Onion for all scenes. Draw the man crying
    and the knife for certain scenes. Then add the text.
    3.Importing the photos should take maybe 15 minutes.
    Drawing apple and orange in their various emotions
    will take probably an entire day. Same thing with
    the man, so we will split the workload. Adding the
    text could take maybe a day as well. We can work on
    this at home.

3) Visualize
    1. I'm not drawing this on paper we'll just wing it.
    2. We will use lines, rectangles, circles, and
    use photos as well. Maybe we can just make the
    faces and import the apples themselves as photos?

4) Checklist
    1. Choose and import photos needed (30 minutes)
    2. Create the facial expressions of Apple and Onion (120 minutes)
    3. Create the man crying (45 minutes)
    4. Add the text (45 minutes)
